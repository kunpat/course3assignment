Since instruction was not clear about grouping I created 3 tidySets. One grouped by Activity, second by Subject, and third by Activity&Subject. 

This codebook explains the variables in tidySet_byActivity.txt, tidySet_bySubject.txt, and TidySet_byActivitySubject.txt

The output of TidySet_ByActivity contains total of 6 rows of data by 562 columns. This output is grouped by "Activity" which is total of 6
Activity variable: The first column contains the "Activity" being performed when data was collected. The Activity can consist of following WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING
Columan 2-562 contains the features(signals). The data contained in each column is "mean" for each activity for that specific feature. 


The output of TidySet_BySubject contains total of 30 rows of data by 562 columns. This output is grouped by "Subject" which is total of 30.
Subject variable: The first column contains the "Subject" the data was collected from. Total of 30 subjects were used. 
Columan 2-562 contains the features(signals). The data contained in each column is "mean" for each subject for that specific feature. 


The output of TidySet_ByActivitySubject contains total of 180 rows of data by 563 columns. This output is grouped by Activity and "Subject" which is total of 180 rows. Each Subject has 6 activities. 30 Subject and 6 Activities gives us 180 average for each feature.
The data is grouped by two variable(subject and activity). Each subject has 6 activities. The feature columns provide average for each subject per activity. 
First column "Activity" contains the activity the person was performing when "feature" data was collected. In this case we get average of the features. 
Second column "Subject" contains the person that was performing the activity. 

Each column's measurement before calculating mean contained following items:

These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern:  
'-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.

tBodyAcc-XYZ
tGravityAcc-XYZ
tBodyAccJerk-XYZ
tBodyGyro-XYZ
tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ
tBodyAccMag
tGravityAccMag
tBodyAccJerkMag
tBodyGyroMag
tBodyGyroJerkMag
fBodyAcc-XYZ
fBodyAccJerk-XYZ
fBodyGyro-XYZ
fBodyAccMag
fBodyAccJerkMag
fBodyGyroMag
fBodyGyroJerkMag

The set of variables that were estimated from these signals are: 

mean(): Mean value
std(): Standard deviation
mad(): Median absolute deviation 
max(): Largest value in array
min(): Smallest value in array
sma(): Signal magnitude area
energy(): Energy measure. Sum of the squares divided by the number of values. 
iqr(): Interquartile range 
entropy(): Signal entropy
arCoeff(): Autorregresion coefficients with Burg order equal to 4
correlation(): correlation coefficient between two signals
maxInds(): index of the frequency component with largest magnitude
meanFreq(): Weighted average of the frequency components to obtain a mean frequency
skewness(): skewness of the frequency domain signal 
kurtosis(): kurtosis of the frequency domain signal 
bandsEnergy(): Energy of a frequency interval within the 64 bins of the FFT of each window.
angle(): Angle between to vectors.

Additional vectors obtained by averaging the signals in a signal window sample. These are used on the angle() variable:

gravityMean
tBodyAccMean
tBodyAccJerkMean
tBodyGyroMean
tBodyGyroJerkMean

The complete list of variables of each feature vector is available in 'features.txt'
