Since instruction was not clear about grouping I created 3 tidySets. One grouped by Activity, second by Subject, and third by Activity&Subject. 

This codebook explains the variables in tidySet_byActivity.txt, tidySet_bySubject.txt, and TidySet_byActivitySubject.txt

The output of TidySet_ByActivity contains total of 6 rows of data by 562 columns. This output is grouped by "Activity" which is total of 6
Activity variable: The first column contains the "Activity" being performed when data was collected. The Activity can consist of following WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING
Columan 2-562 contains the features(signals). The data contained in each column is "mean" for each activity for that specific feature. 


The output of TidySet_BySubject contains total of 30 rows of data by 562 columns. This output is grouped by "Subject" which is total of 30.
Subject variable: The first column contains the "Subject" the data was collected from. Total of 30 subjects were used. 
Columan 2-562 contains the features(signals). The data contained in each column is "mean" for each subject for that specific feature. 


The output of TidySet_ByActivitySubject contains total of 180 rows of data by 563 columns. This output is grouped by Activity and "Subject" which is total of 180 rows. Each Subject has 6 activities. 30 Subject and 6 Activities gives us 180 average for each feature.
The data is grouped by two variable(subject and activity). Each subject has 6 activities. The feature columns provide average for each subject per activity. 
First column "Activity" contains the activity the person was performing when "feature" data was collected. In this case we get average of the features. 
Second column "Subject" contains the person that was performing the activity.
